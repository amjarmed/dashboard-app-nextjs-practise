- ## Mutating Data

  adding the ability to create, update, and delete invoices!

  - ### What are Server Actions?

    React Server Actions allow you to run asynchronous code directly on the server. They eliminate the need to create API endpoints to mutate your data. Instead, you write asynchronous functions that execute on the server and can be invoked from your Client or Server Components.

    Security is a top priority for web applications, as they can be vulnerable to various threats. This is where Server Actions come in. They offer an effective security solution, protecting against different types of attacks, securing your data, and ensuring authorized access. Server Actions achieve this through techniques like POST requests, encrypted closures, strict input checks, error message hashing, and host restrictions, all working together to significantly enhance your app's safety.

- ## VAE and Anomaly Detection

  Variational Autoencoders (VAE) use anomaly detection uses:

  - financial fraud
  - Manufacturing flaws
  - Network Security breaches

  examples :

  - `Uber` has used VAE for anomaly detection in there finanticial tansactions to detect fraud.
  - Google usa VAE to detect network intrusions using anomaly detection.
  - anomaly detection in manufacturing systems
  - in medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI scans

- ## Future Predictions

  - Computure Graphics and Animation : more realistc and believable characters, particularly in 3D modeling.
  - natural language : improved understanding in virtual assistants and chatbots.
  - Energy : Optimizeed consumption and prodution predicted demand managment of renewable sources efficient distribution netweorks
  - transportation : Optimized trafic flow Predicted vehicle maintenance.

- ## in the future

  - generative ai will be used to create a realistic and accurate simulations in architecture, urban planning, and engineering
  - create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design
  - improve the fields of natural language generation improvement in new articles, books, and movies scripts
  - iprove self-driving cars with resalistic virtual scenarios for testing and training
  - Audio to asset generation: speak to generate an assets

- ## the future of Jobs

  - when ever for new technology is created, a job is disapper and new one is introduced
  - parts of your job are reptetive : dirty, dull , dangerous, or difficult. can be automated, you have more time for (creativity, problem solving, empathy , and leadership).
  - Humaity will transcend from a society of consumers, to creastor.

- ## Moral and executive skill set required to work with GenAI

  - Assess whether the generated result fits your quality and satisfaction parameters.
  - Organize a board as an ethical foundaton for the integration generative ai.
